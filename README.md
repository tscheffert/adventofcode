# Advent of Code

This is my repo for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). An advent calendar for coding challenges.

I'll keep notes on each of the days I do.

## Setup

I used Ruby 2.7.1 as the language, installed on macOS with `rbenv`.

```
$ rbenv local
2.7.1

$ ruby -v
ruby 2.7.1p83 (2020-03-31 revision a0c7c23c9c) [x86_64-darwin19]
```

Install dependencies like this:

```
gem install bundler -v 2.1.4
bundle install
```
