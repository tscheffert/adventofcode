# Advent of Code

This is my repo for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). An advent calendar for coding challenges.

I'll keep notes on each of the days I do.

## 2020

### Day 1

Problem: <https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1>

Initially, this doesn't seem that hard, let's try it. I'm not sure whether to use Ruby, which I'm most familiar with, or something more avante garde like Rust. I guess we'll start with Ruby and see if I feel the drive to mix it up later.
